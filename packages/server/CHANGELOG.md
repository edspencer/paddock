# @paddock/server

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/55) [`15cb5ec`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/15cb5ec4c8d92805795d6c3f898fbf0a5ebd5d02) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Support running slash commands (e.g. `/compact`) in chat.

  Typing a leading-slash message in the composer now routes to a new `chat:command`
  WebSocket path instead of being sent as a plain prompt. The server drives
  herdctl's streaming chat session (`openChatSession`) so the Claude Code CLI
  dispatches the command against the current session — `/compact` compacts the
  real chat history. A compaction is surfaced as a visible assistant note
  ("🗜️ Context compacted (was N tokens)."), and the session list refreshes
  afterwards. Output otherwise streams over the same response/tool/complete events
  as a normal turn.

  Requires `@herdctl/core` >= 5.14.0 (the `FleetManager.openChatSession` streaming
  session API). The session runs on the SDK runtime even though Paddock's keeper /
  scratch agents use the `cli` runtime for batch turns — same subscription auth,
  shared on-disk session store, so a CLI-created chat resumes cleanly.

### Patch Changes

- [#49](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/49) [`f81eaba`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/f81eaba137469d4908fab66801698b1b31d94834) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Select the chromium engine for the browser MCP (`--browser chromium`)

  `@playwright/mcp` defaults to the `chrome` channel (branded Google Chrome), which isn't installed on the Paddock boxes — so the browser MCP stalled at first use asking to `playwright install chrome`. Pass `--browser chromium` so it uses the open-source Chromium the `paddock` role installs. Verified end-to-end: a keeper-style `claude` session now drives the headless browser and reads live page content.

### Minor Changes

- [#48](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/48) [`876e33c`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/876e33c087f6c362a0dd2c827c2e4f330a81dd72) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Add an optional Playwright browser MCP to the keeper + scratch agents

  Keeper and scratch Claude Code agents can now drive a headless Chromium via the `@playwright/mcp` server (navigate / click / fill / snapshot / screenshot). The server is attached only when `PADDOCK_BROWSER_MCP=1` is set in the instance env — so a box without the browser stack simply omits it (no failed spawns) and enabling it is a per-box env flip. The `mcp__playwright__*` tool pattern is added to the default agent allowlist unconditionally (a no-op when the server is absent); the tool-less sweeper never receives the server. Chromium runs headless with `--no-sandbox` (`--isolated` profile) for unprivileged-LXC deployments.

### Patch Changes

- [#45](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/45) [`6cb85de`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/6cb85de30aef18e31dca4a8c5636dd8d608ee6b9) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Chat history no longer renders injected Claude Code context — a skill's `SKILL.md`, slash-command output — as a giant, out-of-order user message. Picked up via `@herdctl/core@5.13.2`, whose session parser now skips `isMeta` user lines at the source. Fixes #31.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#43](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/43) [`c72edad`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/c72edadce629f15f31bb72d0c4c4c9f46220cb6b) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Establish an app-mode release pipeline: changesets-driven versioning + changelog, a multi-arch Docker image published to `ghcr.io/edspencer/paddock`, and a self-contained release tarball attached to each GitHub Release. Packages are not published to npm.
