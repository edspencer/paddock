## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#110](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/110) [`bb5d62b`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/bb5d62b63e5b81e9b41a22cb74355240563c2765) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Slash-command autocomplete in the composer (#103).

  Typing `/` as the first character of the composer now pops a keyboard-navigable
  menu of the commands available to the chat's agent — built-ins (`/compact`,
  `/clear`, …) plus the project's `.claude/commands` and any MCP-provided commands.
  The menu filters by the text after the slash (case-insensitive substring on the
  name), shows each command's name / argument hint / description, and supports
  ArrowUp/ArrowDown to move, Enter/Tab to accept, Escape to dismiss, and
  mouse hover/click. Accepting inserts `/name ` and closes the menu; a fully-typed
  command sent with Enter still routes through the existing `sendCommand` path
  unchanged (this is discovery/entry assistance only).

  Server: a cached, read-only `GET /api/projects/:slug/commands` (and a
  `GET /api/commands` scratch equivalent) backed by `@herdctl/core`'s new
  `FleetManager.listAgentCommands` (herdctl#300). The list is stable per project
  and each underlying call spawns a short-lived `claude` streaming subprocess, so
  `HerdctlService.listCommands` memoizes per agent for the process lifetime and
  de-duplicates concurrent first calls into a single subprocess. Bumps
  `@herdctl/core` to `^5.16.0` for the new API and re-exported `SlashCommand` type.

### Patch Changes

- [#109](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/109) [`59d2b92`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/59d2b92ec0cdc972b6626f87aa5b2dd2190125f9) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Give the project Changes tab a real route, and show untracked files' content (#107).

  The **Changes** tab was local component state overlaying the URL-driven Home /
  Chat / Files tabs, so it couldn't be deep-linked or bookmarked, didn't survive a
  refresh, and back/forward didn't treat entering/leaving it as navigation. It now
  has its own route — `/projects/:slug/changes[/:file]` — mirroring `files[/:name]`:
  the active tab is derived from the URL like the other three, and a specific
  changed file's diff is deep-linkable via `/changes/:file`. The sticky "last tab"
  persistence learns the `changes` sub-path too.

  Selecting an **untracked** file no longer shows a "No diff for this file" dead
  end. `git diff` emits nothing for an untracked path, so the Changes pane now falls
  back to the file's **content** — reusing the existing `GET /files/:name` endpoint
  and its render-kind hint: images render as an `<img>` from the raw-bytes endpoint,
  everything else renders as text (with a "new file · untracked" header). Tracked
  files with a real diff are unchanged.

- [#105](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/105) [`bc093f3`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/bc093f316eb0f3c4b83ef9d83adaec7e5ee3d777) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Give chat-list titles the full row width at rest (#104).

  Each chat row's title button reserved a fixed right padding (`pr-[6.75rem]`) for
  the fork/rename/archive/delete actions at all times, even though those actions
  live in an `absolute`, `opacity-0` overlay that only fades in on hover/focus. So
  at rest a title was squeezed into ~half the available width and truncated early,
  leaving a large empty gap where the (invisible) icons would appear.

  The reserved padding is now conditional: a small default (`pr-2.5`) at rest,
  bumped to `pr-[6.75rem]` under `group-hover/chat` / `group-focus-within/chat` so
  the title contracts to make room only when the icons actually become visible.
  Archived rows keep a persistent archive icon, so they retain just enough room
  for that one icon (`pr-[3.75rem]`) at rest.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- [#101](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/101) [`d572cc8`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/d572cc8f409ffb3f5ee03cca0ef42e733a7af203) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Show a new chat in the sidebar while its first turn is still running (#100).

  A brand-new chat used to be invisible in the project sidebar until its first
  keeper turn's `claude -p` process exited — herdctl writes a run's resolved
  `session_id` into its job record only on completion, so mid-turn the session was
  unattributed and filtered out of the session list. Long first turns were
  unreachable from the UI for their whole duration, and navigating away lost the
  chat entirely.

  The server now attributes a new chat to its agent the moment its session id
  first streams back (reusing the same synthetic job-record mechanism as
  fork/promote), so `listSessions` includes it immediately. The web sidebar also
  pulls the chat list when a session starts running that it hasn't listed yet, so
  an in-flight chat surfaces live — even one started from another client/tab.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#99](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/99) [`b6382de`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/b6382de2bcda9c341cfa88ab086c1416b0dbd8f4) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: archive chats — non-destructive Archive/Unarchive + collapsible Archived section (#95)

  Finished chats can now be filed away instead of only deleted. An Archive button
  sits in each chat's hover menu (beside Fork/Rename/Delete) and toggles to
  Unarchive on an already-archived chat. Archived chats move into a collapsible
  **Archived** section pinned to the bottom of the chat list, collapsed by default
  with a count badge; expanding it splits the list ~50/50 with each half scrolling
  independently. When the currently open chat is archived, the section auto-expands
  on load so you can see where you are. Archiving is a non-destructive toggle — the
  transcript is untouched and the chat stays fully openable, resumable, and
  forkable.

  Server:

  - New `ArchiveStore` sidecar (JSON in the data dir, keyed by agent+session) —
    the same pattern as the sweep watermark; ready to move to @herdctl/core's
    `SessionMetadataStore` when that field ships upstream.
  - Chat DTOs carry an `archived` flag; `POST /api/projects/:slug/chats/:id/archive`
    and `POST /api/chats/:id/archive` toggle it. Deleting a chat clears its flag.

  Web:

  - `archived` on the Chat type; `api.archiveProjectChat` / `api.archiveScratchChat`.
  - ProjectView partitions the list into current + Archived, with the accordion,
    count badge, 50/50 independent-scroll splitter, and deep-link auto-expand.

- [#97](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/97) [`dc9b4ab`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/dc9b4abfe8253b65c939b76602eda1cdc4b75f8d) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: search the chat list from a compact search field (#96)

  Replaces the full-width **New Chat** button above the chat sidebar with a
  **search input + a compact square `+` button** (plus icon only). Typing filters
  the chat list live — a case-insensitive substring match over each chat's name
  and its first-message preview — with the count badge showing `matches/total`
  while filtering. A clear (`×`) button and a "No chats match" empty state round
  it out; the `+` button behaves exactly as New Chat did before. Filtering is
  fully client-side (the list is already in memory), so there is no server
  round-trip.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#93](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/93) [`a177845`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/a177845e9af8e3537b5424f810ca868079bebb5e) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: queue a message to auto-send when the current turn finishes (#91)

  While the agent is streaming a turn, the composer no longer no-ops on
  Enter/Send — it **queues** a single follow-up message that fires automatically
  the moment the turn completes. A slim toolbar directly above the composer shows
  the queued message (first line) with a "queued" indicator; hovering reveals
  **Edit** (pops it back into the composer, cancelling the pending auto-send) and
  **Clear** (discards it). Mirrors Claude Code's model: exactly one queued message,
  and re-submitting while one is queued **appends** to it rather than stacking a
  second.

  When the queued message spans more than its first line, the toolbar appends a
  muted **"+N characters"** hint so it's clear the message continues beyond what's
  shown.

  Semantics: the queue is held (not fired) if the in-flight turn errors or is
  **Stop**ped, so a follow-up never lands in a cancelled/errored turn. A queued
  slash command flushes through the command path. The composer placeholder and the
  Enter hint switch to "queue" wording while a turn is streaming.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#89](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/89) [`2679f11`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/2679f114e7a165bd863f72a103342516b3df8ce4) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: fork a chat into an independent child (#77-follow-on)

  A **Fork** button on each chat (in the project sidebar, beside Rename/Delete)
  duplicates it into a new, independent chat in the same project. The fork is
  created **eagerly**: clicking Fork immediately opens a real new chat at
  `/chat/<new-id>` with the parent's **full conversation already populated** and
  titled **"Fork of <parent>"** — so you can branch a conversation into several
  parallel explorations when its context window fills up. The source is left
  untouched, and continuing the fork resumes normally.

  Server: `POST /api/projects/:slug/chats/:sessionId/fork` copies the session's
  transcript into a brand-new session id (rewriting the embedded session id per
  line, `cwd` unchanged), names it, writes an attribution job, and invalidates
  discovery so it appears immediately — mirroring `promoteScratchSession`, minus
  the move/delete. The keeper's `max_concurrent` is lifted from 1 so a project's
  chats (and forks) can run in parallel.

  Web: the Fork button calls the endpoint, records the parent lineage
  (`lib/forkLineage`), refreshes the chat list, and navigates to the new chat
  (auto-focusing the composer). The composer footer shows a **"Fork of <parent>"
  back-link** to the source chat.

  Validated end-to-end against real Claude Code: the copied transcript is a
  discoverable, resumable session that continues with the inherited context, and
  the source is untouched.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#87](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/87) [`0dfd9ec`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/0dfd9ec46c061843aabeed2f726523eaca631673) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Slim the project chrome on mobile so the chat gets far more vertical space. The
  project header collapses to a compact single-row breadcrumb (the project name
  links up to the Home tab; the tags, "Overview" badge, "updated" time and summary
  are desktop-only now, since they live on Home), and a small "+" starts a new
  chat. On the mobile **chat** view the tab bar is hidden entirely — the chat is a
  focused view, and the tabs (Home · Chat · Files · Changes) live on the Home hub,
  reachable by tapping the project name. At 390×844 this reclaims ~90px: the
  header drops 105px→53px and the tab bar (~41px) is gone. Desktop is unchanged
  (full header + tab bar).

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#73](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/73) [`4d3aeb0`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/4d3aeb022b865e2fefe507fba5ad09faed4e8ccf) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Add a project **Home** tab — a real landing/overview for each project. Opening a
  project (the bare `/projects/:slug`) now defaults to `/home` instead of silently
  forwarding into a chat. The Home tab gathers the project summary + metadata
  (with an "Edit details" shortcut), recent chats, a preview of the files, and the
  CHANGELOG — everything deep-linkable via `/projects/:slug/home` and restorable
  via the sticky last-tab. Tabs are now **Home · Chat · Files · Changes**; the
  former "Files & Changelog" tab is just **Files** (summary + changelog moved to
  Home). This also gives the mobile UI a proper navigation hub.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#84](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/84) [`c1ecf0e`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/c1ecf0ee47def5bbd87e9e39bfa081db118c84c6) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: per-chat context-window ring in the chat list (#77)

  Each chat in a project's chat list (and the scratch/one-off list + landing
  preview) now shows a tiny circular gauge filled to that chat's context-window
  usage, mirroring the in-chat `ContextMeter` (same `tokens / limit` percentage,
  amber at ≥80%). The ring hides for chats with no usage data yet.

  Server-side, the chat-list DTOs (`GET /api/projects/:slug`,
  `/api/projects/:slug/chats`, `/api/chats`) now include `contextTokens` /
  `contextLimit`, derived from the same `sessionUsage` + `getContextLimit` the
  `/context` endpoint uses. Per-session usage reads are memoized on transcript
  mtime (`HerdctlService.sessionUsageCached`) so an unchanged transcript isn't
  re-scanned on every list build.

- [#83](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/83) [`d382c5a`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/d382c5a86825722cde9a751b8ba7c96b5ab2ab52) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: persist unsent composer drafts per chat (#76)

  Typing a message in a chat's composer and switching to another chat — or
  refreshing the page — no longer loses the draft. Unsent composer text is now
  persisted per chat in `localStorage` (keyed by session id, or `new:<slug>` for a
  not-yet-established chat), restored when the chat is reopened, and forgotten once
  the message is sent. Mirrors the existing per-chat model-selection persistence
  (`lib/chatModel.ts`); storage access is guarded so private-mode / quota errors
  never surface.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#80](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/80) [`28ed532`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/28ed5322b779e2ae74faa09c69deb9a968b3c3db) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: configurable per-instance branding — title, logo, accent color (#34)

  Running several Paddock instances side by side (Projects, Homelab, House, …)
  now lets each be told apart at a glance. Three new env vars, all optional with
  defaults that preserve today's look (🐎 / "Paddock" / terracotta):

  - `PADDOCK_BRAND_NAME` — the wordmark + browser tab title.
  - `PADDOCK_BRAND_LOGO` — the logo glyph/emoji, or a URL/absolute path to an
    image (rendered as an `<img>`).
  - `PADDOCK_BRAND_ACCENT` — the accent color (hex) driving the primary buttons
    (New Project / New Chat) and the logo chip.

  Branding is **runtime** config (one image serves every instance): the server
  injects it into `index.html` at serve time — a `window.__PADDOCK_CONFIG__`
  global plus a `:root` accent override — so there's no title/color flash before
  first paint. The accent moved from build-time Tailwind constants to CSS custom
  properties (`--accent*`, kept as RGB channels so opacity modifiers like
  `bg-accent/15` still work); the 600/700 hover shades are derived from the base.

- [#81](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/81) [`02b6ac2`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/02b6ac23c5a9120840dea96dd4b05de5ec8498fe) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: per-project keeper-agent settings UI (#12)

  The Edit Project modal now surfaces a project's keeper-agent config, editable in
  the UI: **model**, **permission mode**, **max turns**, and **Docker sandbox**
  on/off. Previously only `model` was persisted per project (and not exposed in
  the UI); `permission_mode`, `max_turns`, and `docker` existed only as fleet-wide
  defaults.

  Each setting is optional on disk and inherits the fleet default when unset (the
  DTO resolves the concrete value). Saving validates the values server-side (400
  on a bad model / permission mode / out-of-range max_turns / non-boolean docker)
  and re-registers the project's keeper agent so the change takes effect. The
  default values are now shared constants, so the fleet `defaults` block and the
  per-project resolution stay in sync.

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/79) [`b587822`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/b58782263d9b4de27470637a3211d74eef637b9d) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - chore(web): code-split the bundle (#11)

  The markdown renderer (react-markdown + remark-gfm) and the four top-level route
  components are now loaded as separate async chunks instead of sitting in the
  entry bundle:

  - `Markdown` lazy-loads its renderer (`MarkdownRenderer`) via `React.lazy`, with
    a plaintext fallback so streaming chat never flashes empty while the chunk
    fetches. `mermaid` was already dynamically imported.
  - The router (`main.tsx`) lazy-loads `ProjectsGrid`, `ProjectView`,
    `ProjectRedirect`, and `OneOffChat`; `AppShell` wraps `<Outlet>` in a Suspense
    boundary with an unobtrusive spinner.

  Result: the entry chunk drops from ~474 kB / 144 kB gzip to ~230 kB / 74 kB gzip
  (−48% gzip). react-markdown and each route now load on demand.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#74](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/74) [`bc189ab`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/bc189ab3396b597f0e9c41046d04740087c574d0) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Render sub-agent (Task/Agent tool) activity in the chat UI (#37)

  Sub-agent launches now render as a labelled, expandable block showing the
  sub-agent type and description. Expanding lazy-loads the sub-agent's own
  step-by-step transcript inline, recursively (a sub-agent that spawns its own
  sub-agents is expandable to any depth). Implemented entirely paddock-side by
  reading the on-disk `subagents/*.meta.json` sidecars and reusing
  `@herdctl/core`'s `parseSessionMessages`; no upstream change. Handles both the
  `Task` (Claude Code) and `Agent` (Agent SDK) tool names.

### Patch Changes

- [#71](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/71) [`30e24eb`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/30e24eb5873bbb63f92bce36e8b81f072fc5b200) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Lock document scroll on mobile so the app chrome no longer drags with the page.
  The UI is a fixed-height shell whose panes scroll internally, but the document
  itself was still scrollable — so on mobile Safari a swipe that started on the
  "fixed" top bar or composer rubber-band-scrolled the whole page. Lock
  `overflow` + `overscroll-behavior` on html/body (and keep momentum inside the
  transcript with `overscroll-contain`); only the inner panes scroll now.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#69](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/69) [`394715f`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/394715f093ced935a5f93956cfe70953c8f6cc61) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Add voice dictation to the chat composer (#voice). A microphone button next to
  Send lets you record a spoken message that is transcribed with Whisper and
  dropped into the text area. Works on desktop and mobile.

  Two backends, selected per-instance via `PADDOCK_WHISPER_*` env (mirroring
  HushPod's whisper config so both can share one server):

  - **remote** — POST audio to an OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions`
    endpoint (`PADDOCK_WHISPER_ENDPOINT`, e.g. a GPU box running
    whisper-server / faster-whisper-server / speaches).
  - **local** — run whisper.cpp on the box via the optional `nodejs-whisper`
    dependency (needs `ffmpeg`).

  Dictation is **off by default** — a plain instance shows no mic button. When
  enabled but the browser can't capture audio (e.g. served over plain HTTP, which
  blocks `getUserMedia`), the button is shown disabled with an explanatory tooltip
  rather than failing silently.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#67](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/67) [`46d5d5d`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/46d5d5d9a15479fb9031dee0b9b12debb4aab1a5) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Show the Paddock version in the sidebar. The bottom-left tagline ("Project-first Claude Code, hosted.") is replaced with the running version (e.g. `v0.4.1`), injected at build time from the package version via a Vite `__APP_VERSION__` define.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#63](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/63) [`e80c044`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/e80c044c03ec1dc4b3f88626a18fe52fb59212bf) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Render image files in the Files & Changelog tab instead of mangled binary text
  (#61). Images had no render kind and the file path read every file as UTF-8, so
  a `.png`/`.jpg`/etc. showed replacement-character mojibake.

  Adds an `image` `FileKind` (png, jpg/jpeg, gif, webp, avif, bmp, ico, svg), a
  raw-bytes endpoint (`GET /api/projects/:slug/files/:name?raw=1`) that streams the
  file with the correct `Content-Type` (keeping the path-traversal guard), and an
  `<img>` branch in the file viewer that loads from it. Image bytes are no longer
  UTF-8-decoded. Byte responses carry a locked-down CSP (`sandbox; default-src
'none'`) + `nosniff` so a directly-opened SVG/HTML file can't execute script in
  the app's origin.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/59) [`ef44f8b`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/ef44f8b0da36d080e0f326b70fe4c7a11dd7a9e3) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Surface which chats are streaming, and restore the Stop button when you return to
  a live chat (#52, #53).

  The server now exposes a session's live-turn status via a `chat:active` signal —
  broadcast on every turn start/stop, sent as a snapshot to a newly-connected
  socket, and sent in reply to a `chat:subscribe` for a running session. It carries
  the running flag + the cancellable `jobId`.

  - **#52 — Stop button restored on return.** Switching away from a still-streaming
    chat and back remounts the pane, which previously lost all in-flight state, so
    the composer showed Send (no Stop) and the running turn became uninterruptible.
    A remounting pane now learns its turn is live (with the job id) the instant it
    re-subscribes, so the Stop button — already correctly wired — comes back.
  - **#53 — streaming indicators.** A persistent "agent is working…" pill (with
    cycling status text) shows under the transcript whenever a turn is in flight,
    including the initial thinking gap and the gaps between tool calls, and it lights
    up immediately on return to a streaming chat. The project sidebar shows a small
    pulsing dot next to any chat that is currently streaming — driven in real time
    from the `chat:active` broadcasts, so it works even for chats whose pane isn't
    mounted.

- [#58](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/58) [`28f06ea`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/28f06ea618ed58178327a78792735f9337af8ce5) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Chat streams now survive a mid-turn socket drop (#54). A turn's frames were bound
  to the single socket that started it and silently dropped whenever it wasn't
  `OPEN`, so an idle/half-open drop (sleep, wifi change, tab suspend, the client's
  own reconnect) stalled the live stream until a manual reload.

  The server now tracks each session's in-flight turn in a `SessionHub` with a
  bounded, seq-numbered frame buffer and fans frames out to whichever socket(s) are
  attached — not just the origin. A new `chat:subscribe` message lets a
  reconnecting client re-attach to a running turn and replay exactly the frames it
  missed (by `seq`), so the stream resumes seamlessly with no gap and no
  duplication. A just-completed turn's buffer lingers briefly so an end-of-turn
  reconnect still receives the terminal frame; if the missed gap has aged out of
  the buffer the server sends `chat:resync` and the client re-hydrates from the
  transcript.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/51) [`bbf6ccf`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/bbf6ccffb3996b06381145c92517e55deb59519e) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Recover the chat WebSocket after an idle/half-open drop. The client now runs a pong-deadline heartbeat that force-closes a silently-dead socket (triggering reconnect), revives the connection immediately on tab focus / `visibilitychange` / `online`, and queues a send made on a stale socket so it flushes once the connection is confirmed live — instead of writing it into the void. The server adds a protocol-level ping/pong keepalive that reaps dead clients and keeps proxies from evicting idle connections. Fixes #46.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/55) [`15cb5ec`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/15cb5ec4c8d92805795d6c3f898fbf0a5ebd5d02) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Support running slash commands (e.g. `/compact`) in chat.

  Typing a leading-slash message in the composer now routes to a new `chat:command`
  WebSocket path instead of being sent as a plain prompt. The server drives
  herdctl's streaming chat session (`openChatSession`) so the Claude Code CLI
  dispatches the command against the current session — `/compact` compacts the
  real chat history. A compaction is surfaced as a visible assistant note
  ("🗜️ Context compacted (was N tokens)."), and the session list refreshes
  afterwards. Output otherwise streams over the same response/tool/complete events
  as a normal turn.

  Requires `@herdctl/core` >= 5.14.0 (the `FleetManager.openChatSession` streaming
  session API). The session runs on the SDK runtime even though Paddock's keeper /
  scratch agents use the `cli` runtime for batch turns — same subscription auth,
  shared on-disk session store, so a CLI-created chat resumes cleanly.
