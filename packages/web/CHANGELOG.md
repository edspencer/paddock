## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#67](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/67) [`46d5d5d`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/46d5d5d9a15479fb9031dee0b9b12debb4aab1a5) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Show the Paddock version in the sidebar. The bottom-left tagline ("Project-first Claude Code, hosted.") is replaced with the running version (e.g. `v0.4.1`), injected at build time from the package version via a Vite `__APP_VERSION__` define.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#63](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/63) [`e80c044`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/e80c044c03ec1dc4b3f88626a18fe52fb59212bf) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Render image files in the Files & Changelog tab instead of mangled binary text
  (#61). Images had no render kind and the file path read every file as UTF-8, so
  a `.png`/`.jpg`/etc. showed replacement-character mojibake.

  Adds an `image` `FileKind` (png, jpg/jpeg, gif, webp, avif, bmp, ico, svg), a
  raw-bytes endpoint (`GET /api/projects/:slug/files/:name?raw=1`) that streams the
  file with the correct `Content-Type` (keeping the path-traversal guard), and an
  `<img>` branch in the file viewer that loads from it. Image bytes are no longer
  UTF-8-decoded. Byte responses carry a locked-down CSP (`sandbox; default-src
'none'`) + `nosniff` so a directly-opened SVG/HTML file can't execute script in
  the app's origin.

### Minor Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/59) [`ef44f8b`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/ef44f8b0da36d080e0f326b70fe4c7a11dd7a9e3) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Surface which chats are streaming, and restore the Stop button when you return to
  a live chat (#52, #53).

  The server now exposes a session's live-turn status via a `chat:active` signal —
  broadcast on every turn start/stop, sent as a snapshot to a newly-connected
  socket, and sent in reply to a `chat:subscribe` for a running session. It carries
  the running flag + the cancellable `jobId`.

  - **#52 — Stop button restored on return.** Switching away from a still-streaming
    chat and back remounts the pane, which previously lost all in-flight state, so
    the composer showed Send (no Stop) and the running turn became uninterruptible.
    A remounting pane now learns its turn is live (with the job id) the instant it
    re-subscribes, so the Stop button — already correctly wired — comes back.
  - **#53 — streaming indicators.** A persistent "agent is working…" pill (with
    cycling status text) shows under the transcript whenever a turn is in flight,
    including the initial thinking gap and the gaps between tool calls, and it lights
    up immediately on return to a streaming chat. The project sidebar shows a small
    pulsing dot next to any chat that is currently streaming — driven in real time
    from the `chat:active` broadcasts, so it works even for chats whose pane isn't
    mounted.

- [#58](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/58) [`28f06ea`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/28f06ea618ed58178327a78792735f9337af8ce5) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Chat streams now survive a mid-turn socket drop (#54). A turn's frames were bound
  to the single socket that started it and silently dropped whenever it wasn't
  `OPEN`, so an idle/half-open drop (sleep, wifi change, tab suspend, the client's
  own reconnect) stalled the live stream until a manual reload.

  The server now tracks each session's in-flight turn in a `SessionHub` with a
  bounded, seq-numbered frame buffer and fans frames out to whichever socket(s) are
  attached — not just the origin. A new `chat:subscribe` message lets a
  reconnecting client re-attach to a running turn and replay exactly the frames it
  missed (by `seq`), so the stream resumes seamlessly with no gap and no
  duplication. A just-completed turn's buffer lingers briefly so an end-of-turn
  reconnect still receives the terminal frame; if the missed gap has aged out of
  the buffer the server sends `chat:resync` and the client re-hydrates from the
  transcript.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/51) [`bbf6ccf`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/bbf6ccffb3996b06381145c92517e55deb59519e) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Recover the chat WebSocket after an idle/half-open drop. The client now runs a pong-deadline heartbeat that force-closes a silently-dead socket (triggering reconnect), revives the connection immediately on tab focus / `visibilitychange` / `online`, and queues a send made on a stale socket so it flushes once the connection is confirmed live — instead of writing it into the void. The server adds a protocol-level ping/pong keepalive that reaps dead clients and keeps proxies from evicting idle connections. Fixes #46.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/55) [`15cb5ec`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/15cb5ec4c8d92805795d6c3f898fbf0a5ebd5d02) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Support running slash commands (e.g. `/compact`) in chat.

  Typing a leading-slash message in the composer now routes to a new `chat:command`
  WebSocket path instead of being sent as a plain prompt. The server drives
  herdctl's streaming chat session (`openChatSession`) so the Claude Code CLI
  dispatches the command against the current session — `/compact` compacts the
  real chat history. A compaction is surfaced as a visible assistant note
  ("🗜️ Context compacted (was N tokens)."), and the session list refreshes
  afterwards. Output otherwise streams over the same response/tool/complete events
  as a normal turn.

  Requires `@herdctl/core` >= 5.14.0 (the `FleetManager.openChatSession` streaming
  session API). The session runs on the SDK runtime even though Paddock's keeper /
  scratch agents use the `cli` runtime for batch turns — same subscription auth,
  shared on-disk session store, so a CLI-created chat resumes cleanly.
