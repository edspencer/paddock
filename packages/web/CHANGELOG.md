## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#73](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/73) [`4d3aeb0`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/4d3aeb022b865e2fefe507fba5ad09faed4e8ccf) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Add a project **Home** tab — a real landing/overview for each project. Opening a
  project (the bare `/projects/:slug`) now defaults to `/home` instead of silently
  forwarding into a chat. The Home tab gathers the project summary + metadata
  (with an "Edit details" shortcut), recent chats, a preview of the files, and the
  CHANGELOG — everything deep-linkable via `/projects/:slug/home` and restorable
  via the sticky last-tab. Tabs are now **Home · Chat · Files · Changes**; the
  former "Files & Changelog" tab is just **Files** (summary + changelog moved to
  Home). This also gives the mobile UI a proper navigation hub.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#84](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/84) [`c1ecf0e`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/c1ecf0ee47def5bbd87e9e39bfa081db118c84c6) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: per-chat context-window ring in the chat list (#77)

  Each chat in a project's chat list (and the scratch/one-off list + landing
  preview) now shows a tiny circular gauge filled to that chat's context-window
  usage, mirroring the in-chat `ContextMeter` (same `tokens / limit` percentage,
  amber at ≥80%). The ring hides for chats with no usage data yet.

  Server-side, the chat-list DTOs (`GET /api/projects/:slug`,
  `/api/projects/:slug/chats`, `/api/chats`) now include `contextTokens` /
  `contextLimit`, derived from the same `sessionUsage` + `getContextLimit` the
  `/context` endpoint uses. Per-session usage reads are memoized on transcript
  mtime (`HerdctlService.sessionUsageCached`) so an unchanged transcript isn't
  re-scanned on every list build.

- [#83](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/83) [`d382c5a`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/d382c5a86825722cde9a751b8ba7c96b5ab2ab52) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: persist unsent composer drafts per chat (#76)

  Typing a message in a chat's composer and switching to another chat — or
  refreshing the page — no longer loses the draft. Unsent composer text is now
  persisted per chat in `localStorage` (keyed by session id, or `new:<slug>` for a
  not-yet-established chat), restored when the chat is reopened, and forgotten once
  the message is sent. Mirrors the existing per-chat model-selection persistence
  (`lib/chatModel.ts`); storage access is guarded so private-mode / quota errors
  never surface.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#80](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/80) [`28ed532`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/28ed5322b779e2ae74faa09c69deb9a968b3c3db) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: configurable per-instance branding — title, logo, accent color (#34)

  Running several Paddock instances side by side (Projects, Homelab, House, …)
  now lets each be told apart at a glance. Three new env vars, all optional with
  defaults that preserve today's look (🐎 / "Paddock" / terracotta):

  - `PADDOCK_BRAND_NAME` — the wordmark + browser tab title.
  - `PADDOCK_BRAND_LOGO` — the logo glyph/emoji, or a URL/absolute path to an
    image (rendered as an `<img>`).
  - `PADDOCK_BRAND_ACCENT` — the accent color (hex) driving the primary buttons
    (New Project / New Chat) and the logo chip.

  Branding is **runtime** config (one image serves every instance): the server
  injects it into `index.html` at serve time — a `window.__PADDOCK_CONFIG__`
  global plus a `:root` accent override — so there's no title/color flash before
  first paint. The accent moved from build-time Tailwind constants to CSS custom
  properties (`--accent*`, kept as RGB channels so opacity modifiers like
  `bg-accent/15` still work); the 600/700 hover shades are derived from the base.

- [#81](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/81) [`02b6ac2`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/02b6ac23c5a9120840dea96dd4b05de5ec8498fe) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - feat: per-project keeper-agent settings UI (#12)

  The Edit Project modal now surfaces a project's keeper-agent config, editable in
  the UI: **model**, **permission mode**, **max turns**, and **Docker sandbox**
  on/off. Previously only `model` was persisted per project (and not exposed in
  the UI); `permission_mode`, `max_turns`, and `docker` existed only as fleet-wide
  defaults.

  Each setting is optional on disk and inherits the fleet default when unset (the
  DTO resolves the concrete value). Saving validates the values server-side (400
  on a bad model / permission mode / out-of-range max_turns / non-boolean docker)
  and re-registers the project's keeper agent so the change takes effect. The
  default values are now shared constants, so the fleet `defaults` block and the
  per-project resolution stay in sync.

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/79) [`b587822`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/b58782263d9b4de27470637a3211d74eef637b9d) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - chore(web): code-split the bundle (#11)

  The markdown renderer (react-markdown + remark-gfm) and the four top-level route
  components are now loaded as separate async chunks instead of sitting in the
  entry bundle:

  - `Markdown` lazy-loads its renderer (`MarkdownRenderer`) via `React.lazy`, with
    a plaintext fallback so streaming chat never flashes empty while the chunk
    fetches. `mermaid` was already dynamically imported.
  - The router (`main.tsx`) lazy-loads `ProjectsGrid`, `ProjectView`,
    `ProjectRedirect`, and `OneOffChat`; `AppShell` wraps `<Outlet>` in a Suspense
    boundary with an unobtrusive spinner.

  Result: the entry chunk drops from ~474 kB / 144 kB gzip to ~230 kB / 74 kB gzip
  (−48% gzip). react-markdown and each route now load on demand.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#74](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/74) [`bc189ab`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/bc189ab3396b597f0e9c41046d04740087c574d0) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Render sub-agent (Task/Agent tool) activity in the chat UI (#37)

  Sub-agent launches now render as a labelled, expandable block showing the
  sub-agent type and description. Expanding lazy-loads the sub-agent's own
  step-by-step transcript inline, recursively (a sub-agent that spawns its own
  sub-agents is expandable to any depth). Implemented entirely paddock-side by
  reading the on-disk `subagents/*.meta.json` sidecars and reusing
  `@herdctl/core`'s `parseSessionMessages`; no upstream change. Handles both the
  `Task` (Claude Code) and `Agent` (Agent SDK) tool names.

### Patch Changes

- [#71](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/71) [`30e24eb`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/30e24eb5873bbb63f92bce36e8b81f072fc5b200) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Lock document scroll on mobile so the app chrome no longer drags with the page.
  The UI is a fixed-height shell whose panes scroll internally, but the document
  itself was still scrollable — so on mobile Safari a swipe that started on the
  "fixed" top bar or composer rubber-band-scrolled the whole page. Lock
  `overflow` + `overscroll-behavior` on html/body (and keep momentum inside the
  transcript with `overscroll-contain`); only the inner panes scroll now.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#69](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/69) [`394715f`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/394715f093ced935a5f93956cfe70953c8f6cc61) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Add voice dictation to the chat composer (#voice). A microphone button next to
  Send lets you record a spoken message that is transcribed with Whisper and
  dropped into the text area. Works on desktop and mobile.

  Two backends, selected per-instance via `PADDOCK_WHISPER_*` env (mirroring
  HushPod's whisper config so both can share one server):

  - **remote** — POST audio to an OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions`
    endpoint (`PADDOCK_WHISPER_ENDPOINT`, e.g. a GPU box running
    whisper-server / faster-whisper-server / speaches).
  - **local** — run whisper.cpp on the box via the optional `nodejs-whisper`
    dependency (needs `ffmpeg`).

  Dictation is **off by default** — a plain instance shows no mic button. When
  enabled but the browser can't capture audio (e.g. served over plain HTTP, which
  blocks `getUserMedia`), the button is shown disabled with an explanatory tooltip
  rather than failing silently.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#67](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/67) [`46d5d5d`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/46d5d5d9a15479fb9031dee0b9b12debb4aab1a5) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Show the Paddock version in the sidebar. The bottom-left tagline ("Project-first Claude Code, hosted.") is replaced with the running version (e.g. `v0.4.1`), injected at build time from the package version via a Vite `__APP_VERSION__` define.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#63](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/63) [`e80c044`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/e80c044c03ec1dc4b3f88626a18fe52fb59212bf) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Render image files in the Files & Changelog tab instead of mangled binary text
  (#61). Images had no render kind and the file path read every file as UTF-8, so
  a `.png`/`.jpg`/etc. showed replacement-character mojibake.

  Adds an `image` `FileKind` (png, jpg/jpeg, gif, webp, avif, bmp, ico, svg), a
  raw-bytes endpoint (`GET /api/projects/:slug/files/:name?raw=1`) that streams the
  file with the correct `Content-Type` (keeping the path-traversal guard), and an
  `<img>` branch in the file viewer that loads from it. Image bytes are no longer
  UTF-8-decoded. Byte responses carry a locked-down CSP (`sandbox; default-src
'none'`) + `nosniff` so a directly-opened SVG/HTML file can't execute script in
  the app's origin.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#59](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/59) [`ef44f8b`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/ef44f8b0da36d080e0f326b70fe4c7a11dd7a9e3) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Surface which chats are streaming, and restore the Stop button when you return to
  a live chat (#52, #53).

  The server now exposes a session's live-turn status via a `chat:active` signal —
  broadcast on every turn start/stop, sent as a snapshot to a newly-connected
  socket, and sent in reply to a `chat:subscribe` for a running session. It carries
  the running flag + the cancellable `jobId`.

  - **#52 — Stop button restored on return.** Switching away from a still-streaming
    chat and back remounts the pane, which previously lost all in-flight state, so
    the composer showed Send (no Stop) and the running turn became uninterruptible.
    A remounting pane now learns its turn is live (with the job id) the instant it
    re-subscribes, so the Stop button — already correctly wired — comes back.
  - **#53 — streaming indicators.** A persistent "agent is working…" pill (with
    cycling status text) shows under the transcript whenever a turn is in flight,
    including the initial thinking gap and the gaps between tool calls, and it lights
    up immediately on return to a streaming chat. The project sidebar shows a small
    pulsing dot next to any chat that is currently streaming — driven in real time
    from the `chat:active` broadcasts, so it works even for chats whose pane isn't
    mounted.

- [#58](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/58) [`28f06ea`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/28f06ea618ed58178327a78792735f9337af8ce5) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Chat streams now survive a mid-turn socket drop (#54). A turn's frames were bound
  to the single socket that started it and silently dropped whenever it wasn't
  `OPEN`, so an idle/half-open drop (sleep, wifi change, tab suspend, the client's
  own reconnect) stalled the live stream until a manual reload.

  The server now tracks each session's in-flight turn in a `SessionHub` with a
  bounded, seq-numbered frame buffer and fans frames out to whichever socket(s) are
  attached — not just the origin. A new `chat:subscribe` message lets a
  reconnecting client re-attach to a running turn and replay exactly the frames it
  missed (by `seq`), so the stream resumes seamlessly with no gap and no
  duplication. A just-completed turn's buffer lingers briefly so an end-of-turn
  reconnect still receives the terminal frame; if the missed gap has aged out of
  the buffer the server sends `chat:resync` and the client re-hydrates from the
  transcript.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#51](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/51) [`bbf6ccf`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/bbf6ccffb3996b06381145c92517e55deb59519e) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Recover the chat WebSocket after an idle/half-open drop. The client now runs a pong-deadline heartbeat that force-closes a silently-dead socket (triggering reconnect), revives the connection immediately on tab focus / `visibilitychange` / `online`, and queues a send made on a stale socket so it flushes once the connection is confirmed live — instead of writing it into the void. The server adds a protocol-level ping/pong keepalive that reaps dead clients and keeps proxies from evicting idle connections. Fixes #46.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/pull/55) [`15cb5ec`](https://github.com/edspencer/paddock/commit/15cb5ec4c8d92805795d6c3f898fbf0a5ebd5d02) Thanks [@edspencer](https://github.com/edspencer)! - Support running slash commands (e.g. `/compact`) in chat.

  Typing a leading-slash message in the composer now routes to a new `chat:command`
  WebSocket path instead of being sent as a plain prompt. The server drives
  herdctl's streaming chat session (`openChatSession`) so the Claude Code CLI
  dispatches the command against the current session — `/compact` compacts the
  real chat history. A compaction is surfaced as a visible assistant note
  ("🗜️ Context compacted (was N tokens)."), and the session list refreshes
  afterwards. Output otherwise streams over the same response/tool/complete events
  as a normal turn.

  Requires `@herdctl/core` >= 5.14.0 (the `FleetManager.openChatSession` streaming
  session API). The session runs on the SDK runtime even though Paddock's keeper /
  scratch agents use the `cli` runtime for batch turns — same subscription auth,
  shared on-disk session store, so a CLI-created chat resumes cleanly.
