Recover the chat WebSocket after an idle/half-open drop. The client now runs a pong-deadline heartbeat that force-closes a silently-dead socket (triggering reconnect), revives the connection immediately on tab focus / `visibilitychange` / `online`, and queues a send made on a stale socket so it flushes once the connection is confirmed live — instead of writing it into the void. The server adds a protocol-level ping/pong keepalive that reaps dead clients and keeps proxies from evicting idle connections. Fixes #46.
