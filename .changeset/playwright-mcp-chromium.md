"@paddock/server": patch
---

Select the chromium engine for the browser MCP (`--browser chromium`)

`@playwright/mcp` defaults to the `chrome` channel (branded Google Chrome), which isn't installed on the Paddock boxes — so the browser MCP stalled at first use asking to `playwright install chrome`. Pass `--browser chromium` so it uses the open-source Chromium the `paddock` role installs. Verified end-to-end: a keeper-style `claude` session now drives the headless browser and reads live page content.
