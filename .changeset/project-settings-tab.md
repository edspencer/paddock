Add a per-project **Settings** tab (`/projects/:slug/settings`) as the canonical place to view and edit every project setting, replacing the cramped `EditProjectModal` (now retired). Settings are grouped and documented — Identity & metadata (name, summary, status, area, visibility, domain tags, labelled links, plus read-only slug/started/created), Keeper agent (model with context-window note, permission mode with a `bypassPermissions` caution, max turns, Docker sandbox, drive mode), and read-only Derived state (overview, pinned files). All "Edit" affordances now deep-link to the tab.

`driveMode` shows its inherited-vs-overridden state: "Global default" surfaces the box-wide `PADDOCK_KEEPER_DRIVE_MODE` (newly exposed on `GET /api/models` as `keeperDriveModeDefault`), and an override can be reset back to inherit. Clearing now actually works end-to-end — `PATCH /api/projects/:slug` accepts `driveMode: null` to delete the override (a plain omitted/`undefined` field could never clear a persisted value).
